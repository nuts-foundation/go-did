// Proof represents a credential/presentation proof as defined by the Linked Data Proofs 1.0 specification (https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ld-proofs/).
// The proof value must be implemented in a custom type since the specification doesn't define the json object for this.
// For example: a jws for detached JSON Web Signatures uses the 'jws' json field
type Proof struct {
	// Type defines the specific proof type used.
	// For example, an Ed25519Signature2018 type indicates that the proof includes a digital signature produced by an ed25519 cryptographic key.
	Type string `json:"type"`
	// ProofPurpose defines the intent for the proof, the reason why an entity created it.
	// Acts as a safeguard to prevent the proof from being misused for a purpose other than the one it was intended for.
	// For example, a proof can be used for purposes of authentication, for asserting control of a Verifiable Credential (assertionMethod), and several others.
	ProofPurpose string `json:"proofPurpose"`
	// VerificationMethod points to the ID that can be used to verify the proof, eg: a public key.
	VerificationMethod URI `json:"verificationMethod"`
	// Created notes when the proof was created using a iso8601 string
	Created time.Time `json:"created"`
	// Domain specifies the restricted domain of the proof
